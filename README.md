# brainmatch
Event project requirement-contributor request matching toolkit.

## Introduction

The purpose of these scripts is to find matches between projects submitted to
a Brainhack Global event and the participants in that event. For each
participant and project, the algorithm generates a score based on the matches
between a project's requirements (e.g. topic, required skills or tools) and the
participant's skills, background and interests.

Once the result is generated, the Brainhack Global event organizers will be
able to send participants an email with information about the projects that
potentially fit them better within the context of the event.

As the Brainhack Global event organizers, if you want your participants to be benefited from the matching algorithm, we recommend you to use the [participant registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dCy9NpprAtd1gZU6FBrvpSX9WwAGS54U_r7pLTiHScI/edit?usp=sharing) provided by the Brainhack global organization as your participant registration form. Before you use the form please make sure that:

- You create a **copy** of the form on your own local Google drive and link your registration workflow to that local form.

- If you want the matching algrithm to work properly, avoid making any changes on the questions listed in the form. However you can add extra questions if you need more data for your own local use and adjust the consent question accordingly if necessary.



## Context

The tools assume that the projects submitted as issues to the [https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020)
repository have been labelled correctly, meaning that they have been assigned
to a given Brainhack Global event, that they have been already published to the
website, and that they contain the appropriate labels concerning their topic
and required skills and tools.

Similarly, it assumes that your Brainhack Global event participant data is
available as a `CSV` file, and that for each participant it contains the data
that will allow matching them to a project. That is, it will contain
information about the participants' skills or background and interests.

Note that in order for the scripts to work, the relevant participant data
needs to perfectly match the available labels in the project issues in the
[https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020) repository.

The scoring method does not currently take into account the required level of
expertise for a project, nor is the participant's desired project type taken
into account.

The scores are normalized to 1.

## Requirements

Besides Python and the Python packages specified in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt),
the tools assume that you have [GitHub's command line tool](https://cli.github.com/) installed.

## Instructions

In order to obtain the project-participant matches, you will need to:

1. Pull the project data locally, by calling the `tools/pull_issues.sh` script.
The script will output a `TSV` file containing all relevant data from all
existing projects in the [https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2020)
issues.

1. Your registration form is likely to use some custom text to gather the
required participant information. These data are expected to be readable as
separate data pieces whose headings or titles can be matched to a set of
standardized fields. These standardized fields used in the scripts to ensure
that the appropriate data can be retrieved for finding the matches.

Since these headings may be variable across events, we expect you to provide a
mapping between them and the standard fields used in the scripts as a `JSON`
file. These standard fields are the following:

```
"email_address_field":,
"experience_programming_field":,
"experience_modality_field":,
"experience_tools_field":,
"experience_topic_field":,
"experience_git_skills_field":,
"desired_programming_field":,
"desired_modality_field":,
"desired_tools_field":,
"desired_topic_field":
```

Assuming that your Brainhack Global local event label is `bhg:donostia_esp_1`
(i.e. you are organizing the BHG Donostia event); the project data file pulled
was called `data/projects.tsv`; your participant registration data is contained
in `data/event_registration.csv`; the mapping of your custom fields to the
standard fields is contained in `data/fields.json`; you are naming your output
file `data/match.csv`; and that you would like to additionally restrict the
score sorting to a top-5, you will be calling the script as:

```
python brainmatch.py
    bhg:boston_usa_1
    data/projects.tsv
    data/participant_registration.csv
    data/fields.json
    data/match.csv
    --n 5
```

The script will write the result of the project-contributor match to the
`data/match.csv` file, and the top `n` scores in descending order will be
written to `data/match_top.csv`.

Example input files and expected output files are provided in the `data`
folder.
